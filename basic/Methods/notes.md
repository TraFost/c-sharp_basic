## Static Methods

Since the `Add` method is static, you cannot call it using an instance of the `StaticMethod` class. Instead, you must use the class name (`StaticMethod`) to call it directly.

## Instance Methods

If `Add` were not static, you would need to create an instance of `StaticMethod` to call it.
