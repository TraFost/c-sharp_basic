In C#: Functions = Methods
Since C# is an object-oriented language, all functions are technically methods because they must exist inside a class or struct.

Key Differences Between Functions and Methods
Aspect Function Method
Definition A standalone block of code that performs a task. A function that is tied to a class or object.
Context Functions exist independently of classes or objects. Methods are always part of a class or object.
Examples Found in non-OOP languages like C or JavaScript. Found in OOP languages like C#, Java, Python.
Call Mechanism Called directly by their name (e.g., add(3, 5)). Called using an object or class (e.g., obj.Method() or Class.Method()).
